# BackendTest_Horizon45_
This project has the appearance of an API server built with Virtual Studios. This API's primary function is to link clients together and expose them to a list of registered drivers, each of whom has a login and personal information. Additionally, a truck will be allocated to each driver with a special code. The project also has the necessary HTML Python scripts, models, views, forms and urls. The local server's postgress SQl databases have been connected to the models using vscode. The Django engine, username, and port were manually modified to enable the client to store their papers in the Postgress database. The data will subsequently be sent through the API to the client's endpoint or terminal. Additionally, the models were altered to return to the mainpage.

Used Libraries for this test: 
1- Coursera (Python-Django for everyone) 
2- Stackoverflow 
3-Youtube. 
4-Gethub.

Justification for using the formentioned libraries:

1-Libraries provide pre-built functionality, saving development time and effort. 
2-They are often well-tested and maintained by a community of developers. 
3-Libraries can provide optimized and efficient implementations of common tasks. 
4-They promote code reuse and modularity, leading to cleaner and more maintainable code. 
5-Libraries can offer specialized functionality that may not be feasible or practical to implement 6-from scratch.

Potential improvements:

1- Regularly updating libraries to the latest versions to benefit from bug fixes, performance enhancements, and new features.
2- Conducting code reviews and audits to ensure the libraries are being used correctly and efficiently. 
3- Monitoring the libraries for any security vulnerabilities and promptly applying patches or updates. 
4- Considering alternative libraries if performance, maintainability, or specific requirements are not adequately met.

Production considerations:

1-Ensuring the selected libraries are compatible with the production environment, including operating systems, hardware, and dependencies. 
2-Evaluating the performance impact of the libraries and ensuring they meet the required performance criteria. 
3-Considering the long-term maintenance and support of the libraries, including the responsiveness of the library's community and the availability of documentation. 
4-Assessing the licensing terms of the libraries and ensuring they align with the project's requirements and legal obligations. 
5-Mitigating any potential risks associated with the libraries, such as security vulnerabilities or compatibility issues with future updates.

Assumptions made during the design process:

1-Assumptions about the data structure, format, and relationships based on the requirements and specifications provided. 
2-Assumptions about the performance and scalability requirements, such as the expected data volume and the number of concurrent users. 
3-Assumptions about the availability of external systems or services that the schema may interact with. 
4-Assumptions about the desired functionality and features of the system, considering potential future requirements. 
5-It's important to note that the specific justifications and considerations for libraries used in a given project may vary depending on the context, requirements, and the specific libraries in question.

It is safe to assume that the task's goals have been achieved. To Horizon_45, I'd want to express my gratitude for providing me the chance to take on this challenge and grow from it. I can state with confidence that I've learned an incredible amount about postgresSql, the Django rest framework, Python, along with web and software development, all of which will undoubtedly push me towards a more promising career in the Tech industry. Looking forward to speaking with you as soon as possible, and perhaps taking on new challenges as a member of the Horizone_45 development team.

Best regards, M.T
